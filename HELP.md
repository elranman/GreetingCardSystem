# Getting Started - Greeting Card System

##BASIC Instructions:

1) as help directory - I've created a 'postman' directory with 
   all requested as postman collection and the response I received while
   run it.
   
2) currently , only 2 types of files were supported: txt and csv.
   it wasn't specify in the task , so for the sack of idea , I've 
   implemented these two.

3) the basic scenarios tested using test api:
    + GET operation - receive templates list
    + POST operation - MAZAL TOV template + TEXT file type - success 
    + POST operation - NEW BIRTH template + CSV file type  - success
    + POST operation - NEW BIRTH template + JPEG file type not exist - failure
    + PUT operation  - upload a card using PUT - success

   thanks for your attention and time :)
